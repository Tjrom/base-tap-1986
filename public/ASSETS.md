# Required assets for Base App

Add these files to `public/` so manifest and embeds work:

| File | Size | Notes |
|------|------|--------|
| **icon-1024.png** | 1024×1024 px | App icon. PNG, no transparency. Readable at small size. |
| **og-1200x630.png** | 1200×630 px (1.91:1) | Cover / hero / OG image. No Base logo or team photos. |
| **screenshot-1.png** | 1284×2778 px | Portrait screenshot of key feature. |
| **screenshot-2.png** | 1284×2778 px | Portrait screenshot. |
| **screenshot-3.png** | 1284×2778 px | Portrait screenshot. |

Until these exist, manifest URLs will 404. Base may still verify ownership and index the app; add assets for featured placement.
